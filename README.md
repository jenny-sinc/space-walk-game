pygame side-scroller about walking my dog Doug

  - **Project type:** Side-scroller game
  - **Description:** Take my dog Doug on a walk, but be warned - he's reactive! You'll need to avoid oncoming enemies (dogs, cats, squirrels), collect treats, and try to enjoy your walk without exploding!
  - **Why I made it:** To revise my existing Python knowledge & practice OOP principles
  - **What tech I used:**
    * Python
    * pygame
  - **What I've learned:**
    * I learned Python in a very lax manner - this is something to be improved upon during this project
    * Making your own game is not as outrageously difficult as I thought it was
  - **What went well:**
    * Always pleasantly surprised at how much Python I remember even when I use it once every couple of years
    * It's been fun to think of the gameplay in relation to the story (walking Doug). Lots of opportunities for fun easter eggs & feaures
  - **What went poorly:**
    * I accidentally lost the MVP I made when trying to reorganise my folders (luckily only 1 evenings work & I can make it much quicker now) 

# 🌱 MVP 🌱
* Doug character controlled by the user to dodge other dog enemies entering from the RHS of screen (travelling left)
* on contact with an enemy block, game quits

#  📋 In Future 📋
* treats to collect
* other objects to avoid (trees/shrubs etc)
* health &/ lives
